There is a curse surrounding algebraic effects: once you know about them, you want to use them everywhere.
%
Since I started writing this thesis, I wished countless times that some language I was working with had support algebraic effects or elaborations.
%
So, I think it is incredibly exciting that mainstream language are starting to pick up on the research done on algebraic effects and are slowly adopting this feature. I hope that this thesis can contribute ever so slightly to this adoption.
\\\\
In any case, tread carefully reading this thesis, for you may be cursed.

\paragraph{About the cover illustration} The cover image depicts Rubin's Vase in the shape of the Holy Grail. Rubin's Vase is a shape that is bi-stable, meaning that it can be viewed in two ways. One might see either the two faces or the vase. This represents how effectful computations in Elaine can be given different interpretations with different handlers and elaborations. This version of Rubin's Vase is meant to resemble the Holy Grail. After having chosen the name Elaine for the language developed for this thesis, we learned that several characters in Arthurian legend are called Elaine. One of these characters is Elaine of Corbenic, who is also called the ``Grail Bearer'' or the ``Grail Maiden''.

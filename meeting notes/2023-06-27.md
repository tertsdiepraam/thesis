- What to prepare for greenlight?
  - Presentation? Or just a discussion?
  - Hand in the document? Do I need to get it in a presentable todonoteless state?
- What does Matthijs know already? Do I need to explain everything from algebraic effects onwards?
- Data types and match -> more interesting examples
- Feedback all good and noted in the doc, but not all fixed yet
- Notation for the mathy part? More towards math or more towards Elaine?

Presentatie:
- Laat technische details eruit
- Just algebraic exist
  - e.g. Koka
  - but no higher-order effects
- Solution: hefty algebras
- This work: apply hefty algebras to PL design

- In thesis: explain why dictionary passing is necessary and why do "simpler" solutions not work.

- Planning: zeker in september afronden (tweede helft)
